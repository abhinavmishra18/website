                <li><strong>FORMAT OF THE CONTRACT</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>These terms of sale apply to all goods supplied by Edupedia Technologies, whose registered office A-38, LANE NO-6
SHASTRI PARK
DELHI 110053.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>No contract exists between you and the Supplier for the sale of any goods until the Supplier has received and accepted your order and the Supplier has received payment in full (in cleared funds). Once the Supplier does so, there is a binding legal contract between us.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By way of clarification, an acknowledgement of your order will be sent to you via e-mail when you place your order, but acceptance of your offer to buy the goods will not take place until after your payment is taken and you receive your acceptance e-mail. It is at this point that a binding legal contract is created and any contract is subject to these Terms and Conditions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The contract is subject to your right of cancellation (see below).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Supplier may change these terms of sale without notice to you in relation to future sales.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DESCRIPTION AND PRICE OF THE GOODS</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The description and price of the goods you order will be as shown on the Supplier´s website at the time you place your order.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The goods are subject to availability. If on receipt of your order the goods you have ordered are not available in stock, Edupedia Technologies will inform you as soon as possible and offer you an alternative unit, or credit you for any sum that has been paid by you or debited from your end for the goods.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Every effort is made to ensure that prices shown on the Supplier´s website are accurate at the time you place your order. If an error is found, the Supplier will inform you as soon as possible and offer you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price, or cancelling your order. If the Supplier does not receive an order confirmation within 7 days of informing you of the error, the order will be cancelled automatically.
